  <h2 id="About"> About </h2>
  <p>The Global Health Certificate is a program through the University of Pittsburgh's Pitt's Global Studies Center.</p>
  <p>The goals of this program is to equip students with knowledge of past public health developments and secure them with the tools to make future changes in the field.
      Focuses are made on:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Understanding the Double Burden of Disease</li>
          <li>The Epidemiological Transition</li>
          <li>Primary Healthcare</li>
          <li>Access to Women's and Maternal Healthcare</li>
          <li>Social Determinants of Health</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Through this program, students not only learn about these topics, but are challenged with application based simulations, preparing them for careers in Public Health upon graduation.</p>

    <h2 id="CourseList">Course List</h2>

  <p> There are serveral courses required for completion of the Global Health Certificate.</p>
  <p> Each course approaches Public Health from a different perspective, as this is a very interdisciplinary field. Courses which I have completed include:
    <ul>
          <li>Introduction to Global Health, PUBHLT 1001, Fall 2022</li>
          <li>Global Health History, HIST 0709, Fall 2019</li>
          <li>Patients and Healers: Medical Anthropology, ANTH 1761, Fall 2019</li>
          <li>Sociology of Globalization and Health, SOC 0473, Spring 2020</li>
          <li>Contemporary Issues in Cross Cultural Healthcare, COMMRC 1730, Fall 2021</li>
          <li>Introduction to Epidemiology, HRS 1017, Spring 2022</li>
    </ul>
      </p>

<h3>Contemporary Issues in Cross Cultural Healthcare</h3>

<p>For this course, we got to pick one country which we were particularly interested in studying.
I decided to focus on Sweden. We then spent the entire semester investigating current health problems
in the country and created a plan to try and solve them. I focused on the structure of Swedish policy and the wait times it leads to.</p>

<h3>Final Presentation on Health Care in Sweden</h3>

  <h2 id="summerresearch">Summer Research</h2>

  <p>This summer I had the honor of working with the Liu Lab, located in the Aging Institute with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). This program was called the Summer Undergraduate Research Program, and was associated with UPMC School of Medicine.
    The program matched each student with a laboratory which they spent the summer working with.
    Follow this <a class="two" href ="https://somgrad.pitt.edu/prospective-students/summer-undergraduate-research-program-surp">link</a> to learn more about the Summer Undergraduate Research Program.
  </p>

  <p>Through this research program, I assisted the laboratory and also worked on my own individual project.
This lab was focused on targeting cancer through modified anthrax toxin.
With my job, I was working to find a Lethal Factor (LF) toxin which would be the most feasible for therapeutic use. </p>

  <h3>Final Presentation: Targeting KRAS Mutant Cancers Using Modified Anthrax Toxin</h3>
