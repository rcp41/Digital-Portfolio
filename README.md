# Digital-Portfolio


Welcome to my Digital Portfolio! 

For this project, I created a senior Digital Portfolio. Throughout my time at Pitt I have been working on getting one of the certificates through the Global Studies department, which is the Global Health Certificate. Through this program I have taken many classes, but I am also required to create a Digital Portfolio to showcase what I have learned through this program and in order to apply for graduation with the certificate. The goal of this portfolio will be to demonstrate what I have learned throughout my course work, and also connect it to my personal experience here at Pitt. For this program, my digital portfolio needs to be made a specific site, but I am going to use Atom for this assignment to create a website that has information which I can then transfer over to the other site in the future. 

Throughout making this website, I faced significant challenges. I have never coded before in my life, so this required me to learn everything, even the basics. Although this was a big task to take on, I am happy with my perseverance and determination.  

 
The main information which I included in this portfolio was information about the certificate, required courses which I have taken for the certificate, and a summary of my summer internship. I felt like this gave a well-rounded image of me, from my academics to also my professional life which we be similar to my career after graduation.  

One form of media which I decided to include was a YouTube video about the overall program. I thought this was important to include because the certificate is not very well known, so it can give all viewers a basic understanding of the field of research which I am a part of.   

I also included work which I have created throughout the past four years. I included one of my projects for the course Contemporary Issues in Cross Cultural Healthcare. I decided to use this presentation specifically, because it was a semester long project with analysis which I was responsible for. Another form of media which I included was my final presentation from my internship this summer. I felt like this was the most impressive presentation, as it has many scientific figures which I created myself.  Overall, my goal for the site was to start at the top with a broad introduction, and then if the viewer is interested in the topic, they can continue to scroll down to get more detailed information. For example, my presentation about Anthrax Toxin, is extremely detailed, and not all of my viewers will be interested in reading through all the slides, so this is at the bottom of the page. 

Overall, with the coding of HTML and CSS, what gave me the hardest time was creating an active sidebar and coordinating the CSS for the entire site. I found that the HTML was easier for me to understand, as it almost felt mathematical and systematic. On the other hand, I found it difficult to scale everything to an ideal size and coordinate the colors to make sense on the page. This took me many attempts at trial and error. Scaling my images correctly also took many tries. I found online CSS color palettes, and font programs to be extremely helpful. 

In reflection, this assignment tested my patience, but proved to myself that if I maintain motivated and continue with the necessary research that I can be successful and make a great website.
