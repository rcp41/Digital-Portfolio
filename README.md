# Digital-Portfolio


Welcome to my Digital Portfolio!

For this project, I am going to create a senior Digital Portfolio. Throughout my time at Pitt I have been working on getting one of the certificates through the Global Studies department, which is the Global Health Certificate. Through this program I have taken many classes, but I am also required to create a Digital Portfolio to showcase what I have learned through this program and in order to apply for graduation with the certificate. The goal of this portfolio will be to demonstrate what I have learned throughout my course work, and also connect it to my personal experience here at Pitt. 

My audience for this project will be faculty and potential employers. With that in mind, I intend on maintaining a professional front throughout the website, but I am also hoping to show my personality because I think that can be an asset to my profile or submission. For this program, my digital portfolio needs to be made a specific site, but I am going to use Atom for this assignment to create a website that has information which I can then transfer over to the other site in the future. 

Some media which I am hoping to include is information about my internship which I had over this past summer. I had to create a final presentation for this job so I am hoping to embed that presentation into my site. Additionally, I have some pictures from my summer that I can include as well. Furthermore I hope to add in my class work and maybe what I have learned from a few of the highlighted courses. 

I hope this website and digital portfolio will highlight and encompass my undergraduate career and show my passion for healthcare.
